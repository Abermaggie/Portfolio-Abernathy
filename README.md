# Portfolio- Abernathy

## Description
This project is a "from-scratch" web page that features Maggie Abernathy's biography and the work she has done in coding up until this point.  The web page will serve as a portfolio for any current/future projects while allowing employers to see the skills she is developing. 

The links in the header portion of the page allow for easy access to skip down to any content in which the viewer is specifically interested.

The images in this project are hyperlinks that once clicked will take you directly to the published web site that is now public and usable by other individuals.  

A contact form has been added at the end of this web page so that you can request coding or web developing services from Maggie.
